# Cloud86 Deployment Guide

Your Next.js website uses **Static Export** (`output: 'export'`), which is the most reliable way to host on Cloud86 (shared hosting).

## 1. How to Deploy (Recommended)
You do **not** need to use Git or Node.js on the server.

1.  **Build Locally**:
    - Open your terminal in VS Code.
    - Run: `npm run build`
    - This creates a folder named `out` in your project directory.
2.  **Upload to Cloud86**:
    - Log in to your Cloud86 Control Panel (or use FileZilla).
    - Go to **File Manager** -> `httpdocs` (or `public_html`).
    - **Delete** the old files in that folder.
    - **Upload** the contents of the `out` folder (drag and drop all files/folders from `out` into `httpdocs`).
    - *Tip: You can zip the contents of `out`, upload the zip, and extract it on the server for faster upload.*
